# ISSTracker

This app is a simple ISS tracker I made in order to learn more about javascript. 

The app is built in Javascript, HTML and CSS and I used the following technologies:
- Node.js and Express.js framework for back end code;
- Webpack to bundle my client side javascript files;
- Good old HTML/CSS and javascript for front end;
- The app is running on Heroku servers.
