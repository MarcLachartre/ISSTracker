Hey everyone! 

I quickly developed a real time ISS tracker 🚀 🚀 as a side project and I thought you guys might be interested in it! Funny how slow it looks on a map while it is actually going at around 28 000 km/h 🤓 🤯!!! I guess this makes Thomas Pesquet 👨‍🚀 one of the fastest men in the universe 🤔! Let me know what you think about it!

For my fellow developer friends 👩‍💻👨‍💻, please feel free to have a look at my code: . Any feedback is welcome!

The app is built in Javascript, HTML and CSS and I used the following technologies:
- Node.js and Express.js framework for back end code;
- Webpack to bundle my client side javascript files;
- Good old HTML/CSS and javascript for front end;
- The app is running on heroku servers.

If you encounter any issue with the application, either a bug or a display problem, or that you feel the app is missing something, please don't wait and send me a PM!

I hope y'all enjoy it!
